# Final Project of Digital Logic Design
 
## Getting Started
VHDL implementation of the Convolutional code as part of the Bachelor of Science thesis. This is formally part of the Digital Logic Design course at Politecnico di Milano (A.Y. 2021 / 2022). The aim of this project is the design and realization of a Convolutional Code 1/2 that complies with the assigned specification.

More information about the convolutional code can be found [here]( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codice_convoluzionale)
